1. Create database s;
a. Show databases;
b. Use database  (Use s;)
c. Rename databases- CREATE DATABASE n;
               RENAME TABLE s.s1 TO n.n1;
d. DROP database if exists s;


2. CREATE TABLE s1 (id INT PRIMARY KEY,
age INT NOT NULL,
name VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'modi',
dob DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
yn BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
rating FLOAT DEFAULT 9.9);

a. Show all table (Show tables;)

b. Insert data ( Insert into s1 (id,age,name,dob,yn,rating) values(1,12,â€™hâ€™,â€™2004-03-03â€™,1,8.9),(),() )

c. Delete table  (Drop table if exists s1;)

d. Rename table  (RENAME TABLE s1 TO s2;)
              //ALTER TABLE s1 RENAME TO s2;

e. Rename Column  (ALTER TABLE s1 CHANGE COLUMN salary sal int;)

f. Get Table Structure  (desc s1;)  // DESCRIBE s1;

g. Count Row  
(SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM a5;)


3. Operations- 
a. Delete one row  (DELETE FROM s1 WHERE id=5;)

b. Update value
(UPDATE s1 SET name = â€˜câ€™, age=8 WHERE id=0;)

c. Add Column
(ALTER TABLE s1 add COLUMN id int after age;)

d. Drop Column
(ALTER TABLE s1 DROP COLUMN salary;)

e. Remove all data
(TRUNCATE TABLE s1; )  // DELETE FROM a5;

f. Conditional Update
(UPDATE s1 SET yn=TRUE WHERE age > 20;)

g. Copy Table
(CREATE TABLE s1 copy AS select * from s1;)

h. Top N row
(select * from s1 limit 5;)

i. Duplicate row
(select name, COUNT(*) from s1 GROUP BY name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;)

j. Find NULL values  
(SELECT * FROM s1 WHERE name IS NULL;)

k. Row Matching Pattern- 
   SELECT * FROM a5 WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
   // SELECT * FROM a5 WHERE name LIKE '_A%';

l. Add Unique Constraint  
(ALTER TABLE a5 ADD CONSTRAINT unique_name UNIQUE (name);)
