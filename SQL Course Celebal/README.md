- INSTEAD OF INSERT Trigger  
- INSTEAD OF UPDATE Trigger  
- INSTEAD OF DELETE Trigger  


### ðŸ”¹ Week 5 - Common Table Expressions (CTE)
This week covers **Common Table Expressions (CTE)** and their use in modular query writing. Topics include recursive CTEs, updatable CTEs, and using them in practical scenarios. The assignment implements a subject change request tracker using stored procedures.

#### ðŸ“š Key Topics:
- Common Table Expressions (CTE) â€“ Part 1 & 2  
- Updatable CTEs  
- Recursive CTE  


### ðŸ”¹ Week 6 - Pivot, Error Handling, Transactions & LeetCode Problems
This week introduces **data reshaping**, **robust error handling**, and **transaction management** in SQL Server. It also includes **LeetCode-style SQL problems** that help apply concepts in real-world scenarios.

#### ðŸ“š Key Topics:
- `PIVOT` â€“ Transform rows into columns  
- `UNPIVOT` â€“ Transform columns back into rows  
- Error Handling using `TRY...CATCH` blocks  
  - Error Handling â€“ Part 1: Handling syntax/logical errors  
  - Error Handling â€“ Part 2: Custom error messages, nested try-catch  
- Transactions & ACID Properties  
- `MERGE` Statement â€“ Conditional `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`  
- **Window Functions**:  
  - `ROW_NUMBER()`  
  - `RANK()`  
  - `DENSE_RANK()`  
  - `NTILE()`  
- LeetCode SQL Problems (Performance-focused)


### ðŸ”¹ Week 7 - Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) â€“ Types 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
This week dives deep into **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)** â€” a critical concept in **Data Warehousing and ETL** processes. Each SCD type handles historical changes in dimension tables differently. The assignment includes implementation of stored procedures for each SCD type using **SQL Server**.

#### ðŸ“š Key Topics
- **SCD Type 0**: Fixed dimensions (no changes allowed)
- **SCD Type 1**: Overwrite old data (no history maintained)
- **SCD Type 2**: Historical tracking via versioning or effective dates
- **SCD Type 3**: Limited history with previous and current column versions
- **SCD Type 4**: History stored in a separate historical table
- **SCD Type 6**: Hybrid approach (Types 1 + 2 + 3)

Each SCD type is implemented through a **dedicated stored procedure** to handle `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations based on the logic of that dimension type.


### ðŸ”¹ Week 8 â€“ CDC, SCD Type 2, Dynamic SQL & OLAP Operations
This week focuses on **Change Tracking**, **historical dimension handling**, **dynamic SQL generation**, and **OLAP-style aggregations** in SQL Server. These concepts are widely used in real-world **ETL pipelines**, **reporting systems**, and **data marts**.

#### ðŸ“š Key Topics
- **CDC (Change Data Capture)**:  
  Track and log changes (INSERTs, UPDATEs, DELETEs) to source tables for incremental ETL processing.

- **SCD Type 2**:  
  Maintain a full history of changes by inserting new rows on update, using `start_date`, `end_date`, and `is_current` flags or versioning columns.

- **Dynamic SQL**:  
  Learn how to generate flexible queries at runtime using `EXEC` or `sp_executesql`.

- **OLAP Features in SQL Server**:  
  Use advanced SQL grouping techniques for data summarization:
  - `GROUPING SETS`
  - `ROLLUP`
  - `CUBE`

These operations allow **multi-level aggregations** without multiple `GROUP BY` statements, optimizing performance for analytics.
